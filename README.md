# Learning test-driven development with Python

This repo tracks the work I did through Harry Percival's excellent book "Test-driven development with Python".  

This project offered a fun introduction to the basics of testing [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/) applications, automated deployments / configuration management with [Fabric](http://www.fabfile.org/), continuous integration using [Jenkins](https://jenkins-ci.org/) and third-party authentication using Mozilla's [persona](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/persona/) project.

# Quotable

Quotable is the simple app I created while working through the book. It won't win any design contests (it doesn't even currently render a usable view on mobile devices) and is a bit short on features - but it served its purpose of providing a sandbox to run tests against. As you can see from the code, there's roughly ten lines of testing code for every line of application code. :)
