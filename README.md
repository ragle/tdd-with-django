# Learning test-driven development with Python

This repo tracks my work through Harry Percival's excellent book "Test-driven development with Python" as I learn about the basics of testing web applications written in Python and JavaScript, automated deployments / configuration management with [Fabric](http://www.fabfile.org/) and continuous integration using [Jenkins](https://jenkins-ci.org/).

# Quotable

Quotable is a site I am creating while working through the book.

*  [Production site](http://www.quotable.site)
*  [Staging site](http://staging.quotable.site)
*  [Jenkins status dash](http://jenkins.quotable.site/view/Quotable/) (for staging)

17 chapters in and really enjoying the book / project so far. Highly recommend it if testing, CM and CI are things you're interested in exploring and learning more about!
